# Snake
This is my first snake game written in SFML.
This project still needs to be a little bit refactored(ridding off from global variables)
Things to do: 
add yellow power up special abilities
Hope some of you will like this game :]
It is not pretty, but it was fun to write it.

Things I have learnt from this project:
+STL lists
+how to use iterators
+worm data structure
+template memeber functions
+global variables have static duration
